#FOR ASSIGN POLICIES to INVENTORY_HOSTS#
########################################

# INVENTORY_HOST = all / list of inventory hosts separated by "," / group name from conf '00_conf_divisions_for_inv_hosts'.
    # If "all" -> the configuration will be applied to all inventory hosts.
    # Priority (from lower to higher): all (0), group name from conf '00_conf_divisions_for_inv_hosts' (1), list of inventory hosts separated by "," or individual hosts (2).
###
# POLICY_TEMPLATE_NAME = must be equal to the corresponding policy template configured in the file "03_conf_policy_templates".
###
# INGRESS-FIREWALL_ZONE_TEMPLATE_NAME = the ingress zone is the zone from which the packet originated.
    # Add ingress zone to policy = "firewall-cmd --permanent --policy=some_policy --add-ingress-zone=some_firewall_zone" (for information only).
    # Other possible values: HOST, ANY.
    # The HOST symbolic zone allows policies for the traffic originating from or has a destination to the host running firewalld.
    # The ANY symbolic zone applies policy to all the current and future zones. ANY symbolic zone acts as a wildcard for all zones.
###
# EGRESS-FIREWALL_ZONE_TEMPLATE_NAME = the egress zone is the zone to which the packet is destined.
    # Add egress zone to policy = "firewall-cmd --permanent --policy=some_policy --add-egress-zone=some_firewall_zone" (for information only).
    # Other possible values: HOST, ANY.
    # The HOST symbolic zone allows policies for the traffic originating from or has a destination to the host running firewalld.
    # The ANY symbolic zone applies policy to all the current and future zones. ANY symbolic zone acts as a wildcard for all zones.
###
# FORWARD_PORTS_SET = name of forward ports set for apply to policy. To configure #FORWARD_PORTS_SET edit file "04_conf_forward_ports_sets".
    # DST-NAT configuration.
    # With port forwarding, all traffic sent to a particular port will be redirected either to another port on the local system or to a port on the external system.
    # If forwarding to an external network is required, you must also configure masquerading (SRC-NAT).
    # Possible values:
        # some_forward_ports_set_name (for apply some forward ports rules to firewall zone)
        # empty (for don't apply any forward ports rules to firewall zone).
    # Add forward-port = "firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=some_policy_name --add-forward-port='some-fw-port-string'" (for information only).
###
# RICH_RULES_SET = name of rich rules set for apply to policy. To configure #RICH_RULES_SET edit file "05_conf_rich_rules_sets".
    # Possible values:
        # some_rich_rules_set_name (for apply some rich rules to firewall zone)
        # empty (for don't apply any rich rules to firewall zone).
    # Add rich-rule = "firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=some_policy_name --add-rich-rule='some-rich-rule-string'" (for information only).

    ### For access from zone configured at tmplt 'publ_services_z--TMPLT' to zone configured at tmplt 'control_z--TMPLT'.
    ### Access service = ssh (block 'asrvs_fr_publ2ctrl_plc_set' at '02_1_conf_allowed_services_sets' for '192.168.22.66').

    ### DST at 'control_z--TMPLT' = '192.168.22.0/24' (see '65_conf_initial_ipsets_content_FIN').
    ### At 192.168.68.33 (gr_bridge_connect_only) need to add route "ip route add 192.168.22.0/24 via 192.168.68.22".
	# 192.168.68.22 = another interface at inventory host 192.168.22.66 wich directly connected to 192.168.68.33 (via LAN cable).
