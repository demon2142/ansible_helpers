The directory ("ipset_input") is intended for preprocessing incoming data for ipset.
"ipset_input/add" - dir for add entries to some_ipset (for permanent and temporary sets).
    # Add-file name format VER1 - "inventory_host--ipset_template_name.txt". For add entry to ipset at one inv-host.
    # Add-file name format VER2 - "all--ipset_template_name.txt". For add entry to ipset at all inventory hosts.
	# If a ipset_template is not registered for some of the hosts recorded in the inventory file, then the fact of this
	# will be recorded in the ipset_input/history.
    # Add-file name format VER3 - "gr_some_group--ipset_template_name.txt". For add entry to ipset at hosts of the group (configured at "00_conf_divisions_for_inv_hosts").
	# If a ipset_template is not registered for some of the hosts configured in the "00_conf_divisions_for_inv_hosts"
	# for group "gr_some_group", then the fact of this will be recorded in the ipset_input/history.
	###
	# One line - one record according to #ipset_type (conf-file "01_conf_ipset_templates").

"ipset_input/del" - dir for delete entries from some_ipset. Only for permanent sets (when #ipset_create_option_timeout=0).
    # Delete-file name format VER1 - "inventory_host--ipset_template_name.txt". For remove entry from ipset at one inv-host.
    # Delete-file name format VER2 - "all--ipset_template_name.txt". For remove entry from ipset at all inventory hosts.
	# If a ipset_template is not registered for some of the hosts recorded in the inventory file, then the fact of this
	# will be recorded in the ipset_input/history.
    # Delete-file name format VER3 - "gr_some_group--ipset_template_name.txt". For remove entry from ipset at hosts of the group (configured at "00_conf_divisions_for_inv_hosts").
	# If a ipset_template is not registered for some of the hosts configured in the "00_conf_divisions_for_inv_hosts"

"ipset_input/history" - dir for save add/del history.
    # File name format - "DATE-history.log"
	# Record format - "datetime;+temporary/permanent;+inventory-host;+ipset_template_name;+ipset_name;+add/del;+VALUE;+status"
	    # Datetime format - YYYYMMDDHHMISS.
	    # VALUE = ipset_type-record or incorrect file name (if file name no match with VER1/VER2/VER3).
	    # Status = OK / error (incorrect ip-address, etc).
    # incorrect_input_files / (dir)
