#FOR CONFIGURATION FIREWALLD (/etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf)#
#############################################################

###EXAMPLE (with explanation)
#[some_firewalld_conf_template_name--TMPLT:BEGIN]
#host_list_for_apply=all/list of hosts separated by ",".
    #If "all" -> the configuration will be applied to all inventory hosts.

#DefaultZone=public
    # The default zone used if an empty zone string is used. Default: public.
    # Parameter from /etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf

#CleanupOnExit=yes
    # If set to no or false the firewall configuration will not get cleaned up on exit or stop of firewalld. Default: yes.

#CleanupModulesOnExit=yes
    # Clean up kernel modules on exit. If set to yes or true the firewall related kernel modules will be unloaded on exit or stop of firewalld.
    # This might attempt to unload  modules not originally loaded by firewalld. Default: yes.
    # Parameter from /etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf

#Lockdown=no
    # If set to enabled, firewall changes with the D-Bus interface will be limited to applications that are listed in the lockdown whitelist.
    # The lockdown whitelist file is lockdown-whitelist.xml. Default: no.
    # Parameter from /etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf

#IPv6_rpfilter=yes
    # Performs a reverse path filter test on a packet for IPv6. If a reply to the packet would be sent via the same interface that the packet arrived on, the
    # packet will match and be accepted, otherwise dropped.
    # The rp_filter for IPv4 is controlled using sysctl. Note: This feature has a performance impact. See man page FIREWALLD.CONF(5) for details. Default: yes.
    # Parameter from /etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf

#IndividualCalls=no
    # Do not use combined - restore calls, but individual calls. This increases the time that is needed to apply changes and to start the daemon, but is good for debugging.
    # Default: no.
    # Parameter from /etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf

#LogDenied=off
    # Add logging rules right before reject and drop rules in the INPUT, FORWARD and OUTPUT chains for the default rules and also final reject and drop rules in zones.
    # Possible values are: all, unicast, broadcast, multicast and off. Default: off.
    # Parameter from /etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf


#FirewallBackend=nftables
    # Selects the firewall backend implementation.
    # Choices are:
    # 	- nftables (default)
    #	- iptables (iptables, ip6tables, ebtables and ipset)
    # Parameter from /etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf

#FlushAllOnReload=yes
    # Flush all runtime rules on a reload. In previous releases some runtime configuration was retained during a reload, namely; interface to zone assignment, and direct rules.
    # This was confusing to users. To get the old behavior set this to "no". Default: yes
    # Parameter from /etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf

#RFC3964_IPv4=yes
    # As per RFC 3964, filter IPv6 traffic with 6to4 destination addresses that correspond to IPv4 addresses that should not be routed over the public internet. Defaults to "yes".
    # Parameter from /etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf


#AllowZoneDrifting=yes
    # Older versions of firewalld had undocumented behavior known as "zone drifting". This allowed packets to ingress multiple zones - this is a violation of zone based firewalls.
    # However, some users rely on this behavior to have a "catch-all" zone, e.g. the default zone. You can enable this if you desire such behavior. It's disabled by default for security reasons.
    # Note: If "yes" packets will only drift from source based zones to interface based zones (including the default zone). Packets never drift from interface based zones to other
    # interfaces based zones (including the default zone). Possible values; "yes", "no". Defaults to "yes".
    # Parameter from /etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf
