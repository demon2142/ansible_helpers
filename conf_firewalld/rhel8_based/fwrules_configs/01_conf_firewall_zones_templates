#target=ACCEPT/REJECT/DROP (possible values). #ACCEPT -> will accept every packet that does not match any rule.
					      #REJECT -> reject every packet not matching any rule. The system will send a packet notifying the source of the packet that it is rejected.
					      #DROP   -> will drop every packet not matching a rule. The system just dumps the packet and does not notify the sender.
#interface_list=none/eth0,br0 (for example). Interfaces for include into the zone. Forms type of zone
#source_list=none/IPv4/IPv6/IPrange. IPrange = IP/mask_prefix (for exmaple, 10.10.1.0/24). Source based fw-zone (source_list) has a higher priority than interface_list (zone based on interfaces).
