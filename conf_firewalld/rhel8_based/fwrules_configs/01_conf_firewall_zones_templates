#zone_name=some_zone_name
    #Create zone = "firewall-cmd --permanent --new-zone=some_zone_name" (for information).

#zone_description=empty/some description.
    #Set zone description = "firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=some_zone_name --set-description="some_description" (for information).

#zone_target=ACCEPT/REJECT/DROP/default
    #ACCEPT -> will accept every packet that does not match any rule.
    #REJECT  -> reject every packet not matching any rule. The system will send a packet notifying the source of the packet that it is rejected.
    #DROP    -> will drop every packet not matching a rule. The system just dumps the packet and does not notify the sender.
    #default -> like REJECT, but icmp traffic is allowed by default.
    #Set zone target = "firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=some_zone_name --set-target=some_target (for information).

#zone_icmp_block_inversion=yes/no
    #Yes = turns on the inversion of logic - the listed (at #zone_icmp_block) types of messages become allowed, the rest are blocked.
    #No = turns off the inversion of logic - the listed types (at #zone_icmp_block) of messages become prohibited, the rest are allowed.

#zone_interface_list=empty|eth0,br0 (for example)
    #Interfaces for include into the zone. Forms interface based type of the zone.

#zone_source_list=empty|IPv4/IPv6/IPrange
    #IPrange = IP/mask_prefix (for exmaple, 10.10.1.0/24).
    #Source based fw-zone (source_list) has a higher priority than interface_list (zone based on interfaces).

#zone_allowed_services=empty/http,https (for example)
    #Opens the standard port(s) of a specific service. For incoming connections.

#zone_allowed_ports=empty|1234/tcp,1234/udp,60000-61000/udp (for example)
    #For incoming connections.

#zone_allowed_protocols=empty|tcp,udp,gre (etc) (for example)
    #If 'empty' -> allow all protocols. If at least one (or several) protocol is defined, then only it will be allowed for the zone.

#zone_forward

#zone_masquerade_general=yes/no
    #Yes = enable masquerade option between all interfaces/sources included into the zone.

#zone_forward_ports

#zone_allowed_source_ports=empty|8080/tcp,5060-5061/udp
    #The option sets the allowed ports for outgoing traffic.
    #If set to empty, then ports for outgoing traffic will be assigned from the range of 30000-60000 (approximately).

#zone_icmp_block

#zone_rich_rules_list->begin
#Every line between 'zone_rich_rules_list->begin' and 'zone_rich_rules_list->end' = rich rule
#zone_rich_rules_list->end
