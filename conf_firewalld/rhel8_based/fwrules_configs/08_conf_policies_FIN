#FOR ASSIGN POLICIES to INVENTORY_HOSTS#
########################################

# INVENTORY_HOST = all/list of inventory hosts separated by ",".
    # If "all" -> the configuration will be applied to all inventory hosts.
    # Configurations like "all" have low priority over host groups (separated by ",") or individual hosts.
###
# POLICY_TEMPLATE_NAME = must be equal to the corresponding policy template configured in the file "03_conf_policy_templates".
###
# INGRESS-FIREWALL_ZONE_TEMPLATE_NAME = the ingress zone is the zone from which the packet originated.
    # Add ingress zone to policy = "firewall-cmd --permanent --policy=some_policy --add-ingress-zone=some_firewall_zone" (for information only).
###
# EGRESS-FIREWALL_ZONE_TEMPLATE_NAME = the egress zone is the zone to which the packet is destined.
    # Add egress zone to policy = "firewall-cmd --permanent --policy=some_policy --add-egress-zone=some_firewall_zone" (for information only).
###
# FORWARD_PORTS_SET = name of forward ports set for apply to policy. To configure #FORWARD_PORTS_SET edit file "04_conf_zone_forward_ports_sets".
    # DST-NAT configuration.
    # With port forwarding, all traffic sent to a particular port will be redirected either to another port on the local system or to a port on the external system.
    # If forwarding to an external network is required, you must also configure masquerading (SRC-NAT).
    # Possible values:
        # some_forward_ports_set_name (for apply some forward ports rules to firewall zone)
        # empty (for don't apply any forward ports rules to firewall zone).
###
# RICH_RULES_SET = name of rich rules set for apply to policy. To configure #RICH_RULES_SET edit file "05_conf_zone_rich_rules_sets".
    # Possible values:
        # some_rich_rules_set_name (for apply some rich rules to firewall zone)
        # empty (for don't apply any rich rules to firewall zone).
