# INVENTORY_HOST = all/list of inventory hosts separated by ",".
    # If "all" -> the configuration will be applied to all inventory hosts.
    # Configurations like "all" have low priority over host groups (separated by ",") or individual hosts.

    # If forwarding to an external network is required, you must also configure masquerading (SRC-NAT).
    # Possible values:
        # some_forward_ports_set_name (for apply some forward ports rules to firewall zone)
        # empty (for don't apply any forward ports rules to firewall zone).
