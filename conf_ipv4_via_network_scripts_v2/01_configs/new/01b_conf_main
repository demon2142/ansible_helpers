# INV_HOST - host-ip/domain-name from inventory "conf_network_scripts_hosts".
###
# CONF_ID - string without spaces. The parameter must be unique in this configuration file.
# Must contains only numbers, latin chars and symbol '_'.
###
# CONF_TYPE (possible values): just_interface, interface-vlan, virt_bridge, just_bridge, bridge-vlan, just_bond, bond-vlan, bond-bridge, bond-bridge-vlan.
# For using vlans port (or ports for bonding) at switch/router-side must be in trunk state.
###
# INT_LIST - list of interfaces separated by "," (without spaces) or just one interface name.
# If using vlan then interface will be renamed to "interface_name.vlan_id" automatically. At INT_LIST is not need add VLAN_ID to the interface names manually.
# For conf_type virt_bridge set "no".
###
# VLAN_ID - defines vlan identificator. Possible values: no (native-vlan=1) or some vlan-id (for example, 10).
###
# BOND_NAME - used only for config_type="just_bond/bond-vlan/bond-bridge/bond-bridge-vlan". Sets bond-name for connections with bond using.
# If bonding is not used, then set it to "no".
# The parameter must begin with "bnd" and contains only numbers, latin chars and symbol '_'.
# If bonding is used, you need to make changes to the file "00d_conf_bond_opts".
# If a bond connection is used together with a vlan, then the resulting name (on the remote side) will look 
# like “bond_name.vlan_id”. This happens automatically. There is no need to manually enter the bond name with vlan_id.
###
# BRIDGE_NAME - used only for config_type="virt_bridge/just_bridge/bridge-vlan/bond-bridge/bond-bridge-vlan". Sets bridge-name for connections with bridge using.
# If bridging not using set "no".
# The parameter must begin with "br" and contains only numbers, latin chars and symbol '_'.
# Must be unique within a current host.
###
# DEFROUTE - enables default route for CONF_ID. Possible values = yes/no.
